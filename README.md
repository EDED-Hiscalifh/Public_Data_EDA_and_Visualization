# Public_Data_EDA_and_Visualization
  
  
## What is for 
This repository is my personal space for practicing data analysis and visualization.  
There are projects by version which stands for what i am focusing.  
These data source is from data.go.kr (https://www.data.go.kr/) and kaggle where provides free datasets to public.  

What i am focusing on is in below :  
- practice high skill pandas library when do EDA 
- practice visualization (plotly -> DASH -> Tablue)
- practice visualization by variable type.
